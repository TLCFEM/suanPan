## Introduction

[üßÆ **suanPan**](https://tlcfem.github.io/suanPan/) is a finite element method (FEM) simulation platform for applications in fields such as solid mechanics and civil/structural/seismic engineering.
**suanPan** is written in modern high-quality C++ code and is targeted to provide an efficient, concise, flexible and reliable FEM simulation platform.

**suanPan** is partially influenced by popular (non-)commercial FEA packages, such
as [ABAQUS UNIFIED FEA](https://www.3ds.com/products-services/simulia/products/abaqus/), [ANSYS](http://www.ansys.com/)
and [OpenSees](http://opensees.berkeley.edu/).

## Features

The highlights of **suanPan** are

- ‚úÖ ***fast***, memory and thread safe
- ‚úÖ [shared memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_memory) parallelism support
- ‚úÖ [distributed memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_memory) parallelism support
- ‚úÖ multi-architecture (`amd64` and `arm64`) [support](https://hub.docker.com/r/tlcfem/suanpan)
- ‚úÖ rich collection of elements, materials, time integration methods, etc.
- ‚úÖ open source and easy to extend
- ‚úÖ modern language features

## Quick Start

Execute the application out-of-the-box in terminal on Linux using one of the following commands depending on how the application is obtained.
See details below.

```bash
# in folder bin/ for linux portable tarball
./suanPan.sh
# for linux packages and snap
suanPan
# for flatpak
flatpak run io.github.tlcfem.suanPan
```

Or on Windows,

```powershell
# in the folder containing suanPan.exe
.\suanPan.exe
```

First time users can use `overview` command to go through a quick introduction.

suanPan ~<> overview
```

Sample models are available for almost all models/commands.
Please check the `Example` folder for details.
Further details can be seen [here](https://tlcfem.gitbook.io/suanpan-manual/tutorial/obtain) regarding how to run model files.

## Installation

> [!WARNING]
> Only the 64-bit version is compiled.
> It is assumed that [**AVX2**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Vector_Extensions) is available thus if the program
> fails, please check if your CPU supports AVX2.
> Alternatively, you can try the `no-avx` version.

### Windows

> [!NOTE]
> The dependencies are bundled with the archive.
> One may also install the VC++ redistributable [package](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe).
> If the application prompts that some file, such as `msvcp140.dll`, is missing (unlikely), please install the redistributable package.

#### Binary Package

The archives of binaries are released under [Release](https://github.com/TLCFEM/suanPan/releases) page.

1. `suanpan-win-mkl-vtk.zip` is the portable archive.
2. `suanpan-win-mkl-vtk.exe` is the installer.

#### Chocolatey

The binaries, which are compiled with Intel MKL and VTK, are available
on [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/packages/suanpan), please use the following command to install the package.

1. Follow the [instructions](https://chocolatey.org/install) to install Chocolatey.

2. Use the following command to install `suanPan`.

   ```ps
   choco install suanpan
   ```

3. It is recommended to use a modern terminal such as [Windows Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal) for better output display.

The Chocolatey repo available to you may not be up-to-date.
If the latest version is not available, please try alternatives, such as portable binaries or scoop.

[<p align="center"><img src="Resource/choco.gif"></p>](https://asciinema.org/a/684063)

#### Scoop

It is also possible to use [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/) to install the package.

1. Install [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/).

   ```ps
   Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -scope CurrentUser
   iwr -useb get.scoop.sh | iex
   ```

2. Install `suanPan`.

   ```ps
   scoop install suanpan
   ```

### Linux

Linux users are recommended to obtain the binaries via `snap` or `flatpak`.

#### Snap

The snap supports visualisation via VTK and uses Intel MKL for linear algebra.
The `edge` channel is in sync with the `dev` branch.
The `stable` channel is in sync with the `master` branch.

[![snap](https://snapcraft.io/static/images/badges/en/snap-store-black.svg)](https://snapcraft.io/suanpan)

[<p align="center"><img src="Resource/snap.gif"></p>](https://asciinema.org/a/684061)

#### Flatpak

Flatpak is also available if preferred.
The `beta` channel is in sync with the `dev` branch.
The `stable` channel is in sync with the `master` branch.

<a href='https://flathub.org/apps/details/io.github.tlcfem.suanPan'><img width='200' alt='Download on Flathub' src='https://flathub.org/assets/badges/flathub-badge-en.svg'/></a>

```bash
# add repo
flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo
# or the beta channel
# flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub-beta https://flathub.org/beta-repo/flathub-beta.flatpakrepo
# install
flatpak install suanPan
# define alias
echo "alias suanpan=\"flatpak run io.github.tlcfem.suanPan\"" >> ~/.bashrc
```

### Docker

It is also possible to compile the package via docker, check the dockerfiles under the `Script` folder, for any
questions please open an issue.

One can directly pull the image.
Using [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/tlcfem/suanpan).

```bash
docker pull tlcfem/suanpan
```

Using [GitHub Container Registry](https://github.com/TLCFEM/suanPan/pkgs/container/suanpan).

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/tlcfem/suanpan
```

### Other Platforms

Precompiled binaries are provided via CI/CD on macOS, Windows, and Ubuntu.
Please download the file from the [release](https://github.com/TLCFEM/suanPan/releases) page.

A few flavors are available:

1. `vtk` --- visualisation support is enabled, with this you can record VTK files for postprocessing, however, OpenGL
   may be missing on server systems
2. `mkl` --- linear algebra operations are offloaded to MKL, which gives the optimal performance on Intel chips
3. `openblas` --- linear algebra operations are offloaded to OpenBLAS, which may outperform MKL on AMD platforms
4. `aocl` --- linear algebra operations are offloaded to AOCL, which is optimized for AMD platforms
5. `no-avx` --- AVX2 support is disabled, useful for older CPUs that do not support AVX2 instructions
6. `win-gcc` --- GCC is used to compile the binary
7. `win` --- MSVC is used to compile the binary

Advanced users can compile the program from source by themselves to enable GPU based solvers which require
an available [CUDA](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-toolkit-release-notes/) and/or [MAGMA](https://icl.utk.edu/magma/) library.

### Automation Related

#### VS Code

The VS Code extension is available [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tlc.suanpan).

#### Sublime Text

On Windows, a batch file named `AddAssociation.bat` is provided in the archive.
It provides file associations and prepares a proper working environment (build system, autocompletion, highlighting) with [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/).
It also adds file associations with `.sp` and `.supan` files, please run the `AddAssociation.bat` file with administrator privilege.
[Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) autocompletion and syntax highlighting files are also provided.
Please install Sublime Text first and execute the batch file with the administrator privilege.

On Linux, a script file named as `suanPan.sh` is provided.

```bash
./suanPan.sh --create-link
```

The above command adds Sublime Text autocompletion and syntax highlighting files to proper location if Sublime Text configuration folder is found.
It also adds a command alias `suanpan` to `~/.local/bin` and a desktop file to `~/.local/share/applications`.
